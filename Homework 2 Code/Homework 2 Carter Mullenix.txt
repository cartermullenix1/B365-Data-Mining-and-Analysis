1.)

a)

We cannot compute the true value from a sample.

b)

801/(801+9192) = 0.08

c)

Kale eaters: 0.08 +- 1.96 * sqrt((0.08*.92)/(9993)) = 0.08 +- 0.005

Non-Kale eaters: 0.12 +- 1.96 * sqrt((0.12*.88)/(99027)) = 0.12 +- 0.002

d)

The confidence intervals do not overlap so we can conclude with 95% confidence that
kale eaters have a lower rate of diabetes.

e)

No we cannot conclude causation from the sample data above. There are other factors that 
could lead to this such as underlying health factors and differences lifestyles.

f)

There are other factors that could lead to this such as underlying health factors and
differences lifestyles.



2.)

a)

Different zip codes can have economic classes leading to differences in medical care and
availibitlity of fresh healthy food. No causation can be concluded.

b)

The health conscience people are eating healthier which can lead to lower rates of diabetes.
No causation can be concluded.

c)

The only difference in the groups would be kale since the groups were assigned using the R
program. This randomness allows us to conclude causation.



3.)

a)

The P(A) and the P(B) both are equal to 0.5 and P(A∩B) is equal to 0.25. The formula for
independence is P(A∩B) = P(A) * P(B) which is 0.25 = 0.5 * 0.5. This is true so they are
independent.

b)

The 95% confidence interval would be computed by 1/sqrt(1000) = .03. The intervals of P(A)
and P(B) will contain 1/2 and the interval of P(A∩B) contains 1/4 so this means that A and
B are independent.



4.)

a)

n = 1000000
A = rep(0,n)
B = rep(0,n)

for (i in 1:n) {
  x = runif(1)
  A[i] = (x <.5)
  B[i] = ((2*x) %% 1) < .5
}
phata = sum(A)/n
phatb = sum(B)/n
phatab = sum(A + B)/n
cat(phata = "pm ", 1.96*sqrt(phata*(1-phata)/n), "\n")
cat(phatb = "pm ", 1.96*sqrt(phatb*(1-phatb)/n), "\n")
cat(phatab = "pm ", 1.96*sqrt(phatab*(1-phatab)/n), "\n")

b)

P(A∩B) = P(A) * P(B) is independent and supported by confidence intervals.



5.)

a) 

The events A and B are dependent because people that think the city is being ran well
could just say that both are doing well since they don't see any problems.

b)

A nd B are independent because the approval of one person does not affect the other.

c)

A and B are independent because the result of one coin flip does not affect the next.

d)

A and B are likely dependent because someone who like the first movie is likely to like
the sequel.



6.)

a)

They are dependent because having T puts you at a higher probability of having S but there 
is still a probability of having T without S and S without T.

b)

P(T) = 0.30
P(S∣T) = 0.90
P(S) = P(T) * P(S∣T) + (1 − P(T)) * P(S∣¬T)
= 0.30 * 0.90 + 0.70 * 0.30
= 0.27 + 0.21
= 0.48

P(T∣S) = (0.9 * 0.3) / (0.48) = 0.5625

c)

population_size = 10000
prob_T = 0.30
prob_S_given_T = 0.90
prob_S_given_not_T = 0.30

trait_T = rbinom(population_size, 1, prob_T)
trait_S = rep(0, population_size)

for (i in 1:population_size) {
  if (trait_T[i] == 1) {
    trait_S[i] = rbinom(1, 1, prob_S_given_T)
  } else {
    trait_S[i] = rbinom(1, 1, prob_S_given_not_T)
  }
}

prop_T = mean(trait_T)
prop_S = mean(trait_S)

cat("Proportion of population with trait T:", prop_T, "\n")
cat("Proportion of population with trait S:", prop_S, "\n")

d)

prob_T_given_S = (prob_S_given_T * prob_T) / prob_S

(.90*.30)/.48 = .5625

.56 +- 1.96 * sqrt((.56*(1-.56))/n) = 0.55027

It is consistent with my answer to the first part of the problem.
